# GymAssistant

"Gym Assistant" is a project that allows you to add gym-related plans and also record results such as maximum weights for a given exercise. You can also find ways to make mass, which is useful for pressing heavier weights.
It is created in .NET MVC.

## Main Page

On the main page we have options such as "Login", "Registration" (at the moment it was only generated when creating the project, in the future it will be expanded), "Plan", "Maxy", "Total", "Jak zrobić mase".

## Create Plan

We can create a plan that includes options such as a start and end date (the end date is for people who run every day, for example). We can also write out the plan exactly how we want it. The plan can also have a name, for example, which would contain the body parts that we would do.

## Plan

On the right we have options that allow us to edit, view and delete the plan.

## Maxy

Every person who trains should keep track of the maximum weights they can lift for a given exercise. This tab allows us to do so. Additionally, we have a search option, which should shorten the time of searching for a given exercise. We also have sorting options by name and by load. We also have the ability to edit and delete.

## Total  

Total is a special tab for people who focus on weightlifting (deadlift, bench press, squat). Giving weight for 3 exercises calculates our total. Additionally there is a date which allows us to see how fast we progress. Also there is automatic sorting which shows our last total. As before we have the option to edit and delete.

## Jak zrobić mase

As you know, every athlete who wants to squeeze as much as possible should do mass. This tab allows us to do so by displaying different ways. It also has options for editing, description of the method and deletion. Ways are sorted alphabetically.

## FYI

This is just a simple project created because university forced me to do so.
